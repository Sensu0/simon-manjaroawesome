I'll use this to comment on changes I make, starting today <i>3/July/2020</i>.

<b>".zshrc" changes</b>
Removed <i>pipupgrade</i> alias because it no longer works anymore. Added <i>makeiso</i> alias to assist with making iso images from discs in <i>/dev/sr0</i>. Added <i>j</i> alias for jump plugin. Plugin  <i>emoji</i> is now enabled for better compatibility with <i>powerlevel10k</i> theme emojis.

<b>new script</b>
<i>makeiso.sh</i> will execute the same commands as the <i>makeiso</i> alias.
