<h1> My complete config of Manjaro Awesome Edition </h1>

My configurations for various software. If you want to make your own changes, I'd advise you to fork this.

"Update-pip.sh" should be run with superuser/admin privliges (i.e "sudo" or "su") to make sure everything you have gets upgraded.

To use the same theme as me, install <a href="https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k">Powerline10k</a> by romkatv
after installing <a href="https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh">ohmyzsh</a>

<p>Keep in mind that <span style="color:AF002A;">Powerlevel10k</span>, <span style="color:AF002A;">zsh-autosuggestions</span> and <span style="color:AF002A;">zsh-syntax-highlightning</span> are to be stored in <span style="color:AF002A;">.oh-my-zsh/custom</span> folder.</p>
