<h3>Some config files for Manjaro Awesome Edition</h3>

Use this however you want, but fork it if you want to make your own changes.
Shell-scripts are executable out-of-the-box for speedy deployment.

<i>install.sh</i> installs autosuggestions and syntax highlighting. Restart your terminal after installation.

I may  make one script for Powerline10k sometime.

<i>.zshrc</i> can be found at <b>/~</b> (/HOME/USER) path.

<i>Update-pip.sh</i> should be run with superuser/admin privliges (i.e "sudo" or "su") to make sure everything you have gets upgraded.

<i>d.sh</i> turns off the display. I use it to circumvent buggy display drivers.

To use the same theme as me, download <a href="https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k">Powerline10k</a> by romkatv
after installing <a href="https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh">ohmyzsh</a>

Keep in mind that Powerlevel10k, zsh-autosuggestions and zsh-syntax-highlightning are to be stored in your <b>.oh-my-zsh/custom/</b> folder, inside the subfolder for <i>themes/</i> or <i>plugins/</i>.

the <b>awesome</b> and <b>rofi</b> folders are stored in the <i>/~/.config</i> path.
