<h3>Some config files for Manjaro Awesome Edition</h3>

Use this however you want, but fork it if you want to make your own changes.

<i>.zshrc</i> can be found at <b>/~</b> (/HOME/USER) path.

<i>Update-pip.sh</i> should be run with superuser/admin privliges (i.e "sudo" or "su") to make sure everything you have gets upgraded.

<i>d.sh</i> turns off the display. I use it to circumvent buggy display drivers.

To use the same theme as me, install <a href="https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k">Powerline10k</a> by romkatv
after installing <a href="https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh">ohmyzsh</a>

zsh-autosuggestions can be found <a href="https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions">here</a>

zsh-syntax-highlightning can be found <a href="https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting">here</a>

Keep in mind that Powerlevel10k, zsh-autosuggestions and zsh-syntax-highlightning are to be stored in the path <b>.oh-my-zsh/custom/</b>, inside the subfolder for <i>themes</i> or <i>plugins</i>.

the <b>awesome</b> and <b>rofi</b> are stored in <i>/~/.config</i> path.
