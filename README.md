<h1> My complete config of Manjaro Awesome Edition </h1>

My configurations for various software. If you want to make your own changes, I'd advise you to fork this.

"Update-pip.sh" should be run with superuser/admin privliges (i.e "sudo" or "su") to make sure everything you have gets upgraded.

To use the same theme as me, install <a href="https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k" target=_blank>Powerline10k</a> by romkatv
after installing <a href="https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh" rel="nofollow">ohmyzsh</a>

Keep in mind that Powerlevel10k, zsh-autosuggestions and zsh-syntax-highlightning are to be stored in <color:AF002A>.oh-my-zsh/custom</color:AF002A>.
